# sk-php-selector
PHP selector for centos 7 

RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK

This install php 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2 in your centos 6 and centos 7

sk-php-selecto2.sh is fot testing but with it you can select aditional versions of php

So you can select just one version runing it as:

bash sk-php-selector2.sh php72

Or install multiple version

bash sk-php-selector2.sh php56 php71

or install all

bash sk-php-selector2.sh all

This works fine, the configuration of php need some work
